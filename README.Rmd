This is a bare bones dummy R package to serve as a template for package creation with the {[usethis](https://usethis.r-lib.org/)} R package.

The whole package creation covers

- package initialization with {usethis}
- integration of github actions
  - basic package build
  - code coverage using [codecov.io](https://codecov.io)
  - automatic web page generation using {[pkgdown](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/)}
- generating shiny badges ![dummy_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/badge-shiny-brightgreen) for the repository.
- code testing powered by {[testthat](https://testthat.r-lib.org)}

## Installation

You can install the development version of blankpkg from [github](https://github.com/k-hench/blankpkg) with â€” there is no good reason to do this though:

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("k-hench/blankpkg")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(blankpkg)
## basic example code
blank_x()
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE, fig.asp = .6, dev.args = list(type = "cairo")}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
