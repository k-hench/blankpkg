# Generic Package Creation

## First Steps

The initial creation of the package happened with {[usethis](https://usethis.r-lib.org/)} through running the R script `usethis_blank_pkg.R` from the command line:

```sh
RScript --vanilla usethis_blank_pkg.R
```

```r
library(usethis)

path <- file.path("~/work/software/Rstuff", "blankpkg")
logo_path <- file.path("~/Pictures/logos/pkg", "blankpkg.png")
pkgdown_path <- file.path("~/work/software/Rstuff", "_pkgdown.yaml")

options(
  usethis.full_name = "Kosmas Hench",
  usethis.protocol  = "ssh",
  usethis.description = list(
    "Authors@R" = utils::person(
      "Kosmas", "Hench",
      email = "khench@posteo.net",
      role = c("aut", "cre"),
      comment = c(ORCID = "0000-0003-1119-187X")),
    URL = "https://github.com/k-hench/blankpkg",
    BugReports = "https://github.com/k-hench/blankpkg/issues",
    Version = "0.0.0.9000",
    Title = "Blank Package Template",
    Description = "This is an empty package template created with
    {usethis} to test useful default settings
    for new R packages by KH."
  ),
  usethis.destdir = "~/work/software/Rstuff/"
)

create_package(path, rstudio = TRUE)

# only in non-interactive session
proj_activate(path)
# new pkg setup
use_mit_license("Kosmas Hench")
use_package("tidyverse", "Suggests")

use_readme_rmd()
use_logo(logo_path, geometry = "240x278", retina = TRUE)

system("mv README.Rmd README_bu.Rmd")
system("grep '^# blankpkg' -B 1000 README_bu.Rmd | grep -v '^# blankpkg' > README.Rmd")
readr::write_lines(x = "# blankpkg <img src='man/figures/logo.png' align='right' height='139' />",
                   file = "README.Rmd",
                   append = TRUE)
system("grep '^# blankpkg' -A 1000 README_bu.Rmd | grep -v '^# blankpkg' >> README.Rmd")

knitr::knit(input = "README.Rmd", output = "README.md")
system("mv README.md README_bu.md")
system("tail -n +4 README_bu.md > README.md")
file.remove(c("README_bu.Rmd", "README_bu.md"))
use_news_md()

use_testthat()
use_test("my-test")
use_coverage()
use_lifecycle()
use_pipe()

use_vignette(name = "blankpkg_intro", title = "Introduction to the blankpkg package")

use_git()
system("git add .")
system("git commit -m 'init'")
git_branch_default()
```

After that, some manual content was executed from within the new package:

```r
usethis::use_pkgdown(config_file = "_pkgdown.yaml", destdir = "docs")
system("cp ../_pkgdown.yaml ./_pkgdown.yaml")
pkgdown::build_site()
system("git add .")
system("git commit -m 'init site'")
usethis::use_github()
usethis::use_github_action_check_standard()
```

where `../_pkgdown.yaml` contains:

```yaml
destination: docs
url: https://k-hench.github.io/blankpkg/

authors:
  Kosmas Hench:
    href: https://k-hench.github.io/kh/

template:
  params:
    bootswatch: yeti

figures:
  dev: png

reference:
  - title: "Project Configuration"
    desc: >
      General settings that are used to keep plots consistent.
    contents:
      - blank_x
```

And a R script included to add content to the package `R/blankpkg_dummy.R`: 

```r
#' Dummy placeholder function
#'
#' \Sexpr[results=rd, stage=render]{lifecycle::badge("experimental")}
#' This is a small dummy function to exemplify the
#' {roxygen} documentation, the automatic testing etc...
#'
#' @param input character string
#'
#' @return echo the input string
#' @export
#'
#' @examples
#' blank_x()
#'
#' blank_x("something else...")
blank_x <- function(input = "planceholder code"){
  return(input)
  }
```

## Github Actions

Github Actions are a convenient service to automatize some checks and processes after pushing changes in the repo to github.
In this package these include a check if the package can be compiled and installed on several operating systems, checking th code coverage (the percentage of code that is double checked using testing) and updating the {pkgdown} web-page.

To be able to use github actions, the access to the repo needs to be automatized.
For this *personal access tokens* (GITHUB_PAT) are created in the github user settings.
In a similar fashion an access token is created on [codecov.io](codecov.io) and the repo is registered there to allow the monitoring of the code coverage.
Both tokens are added as *repository secrets* in the settings of the repo on github.

Than the actual github actions are defined as *workflows* within `.github/workflows/`:

- `R-CMD-check.yaml`: checks if the package can be build on several OS
- `pkgdown.yaml`: updates the {pkgdown} website upon push and publishes to the branch `gh-pages`
- `test-coverage.yaml`: checks the code coverage of the repo (the percentage of code that is tested)

## Repository Badges

The *build* and *coverage* badge slots are created during the by the {usethis} commands `use_coverage()` and `use_github_action_check_standard()` commands and their content updated during the github actions.
The {[lifecycle](https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/)} badge was added manually to the `README.Rmd`.
This is than rendered as `.md` by running `knitr::knit("README.Rmd", "README.md")`

## Tests

To bump the coverage to 100% a test is added to include coverage for the function `blank_x()`.
Therefore the R file `blankpkg_dummy.R` is opened in the Rstudio editor and the from the console `use_test()` is run.
This creates and opens the file `tests/testthat/blankpkg_dummy.R`, where we add two tests:

```r
test_that("default_str_length_is_still_17", {
  expect_equal(str_length(blank_x()), 17)
})

test_that("alternaitve_inputs", {
  expect_equal(str_length(blank_x("dadum")), 5)
})
```
